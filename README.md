Medical researchers are interested in growth measurements for children. The growth measurements consist of dental measurements from the centre of the pituitary gland to the pteryomaxillary fissure for 11 girls and 16 boys at ages 8, 10, 12, and 14 years. The subjects are individual children, and there are four repeated measures on each. Data is stored in a SAS data set growth. The variables included in the data set are person, gender, age, and growth.
